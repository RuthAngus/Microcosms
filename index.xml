Microcosms is a scientific storytelling program at the American Museum of Natural History that brings scientists and artists together to create new collaborative science-themed stories. Microcosms is an NSF-funded program that will begin in 2022. During each year of the program, playwrights and scientists will work in pairs to collaborate on new scientific plays, and truthful performative stories.</description></item></channel></rss>
